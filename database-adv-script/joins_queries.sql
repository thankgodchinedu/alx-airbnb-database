-- 1. INNER JOIN: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings
SELECT b.id AS booking_id, b.property_id, b.start_date, b.end_date,
       u.id AS user_id, u.name, u.email
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id;

-- 2. LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
SELECT p.id AS property_id, p.title, p.location,
       r.id AS review_id, r.rating, r.comment
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id;

-- 3. FULL OUTER JOIN: Retrieve all users and all bookings
-- Note: MySQL doesnâ€™t support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so use UNION of LEFT + RIGHT JOIN
SELECT u.id AS user_id, u.name, b.id AS booking_id, b.start_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
UNION
SELECT u.id AS user_id, u.name, b.id AS booking_id, b.start_date
FROM users u
RIGHT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id;
